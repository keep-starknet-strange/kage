**Codename:** KAGE (影, “shadow”; easy to pronounce: “kah‑geh”)  
**Tagline:** Privacy is STARK Normal.

KAGE is a polished, Expo React Native wallet prototype that explores end-to-end privacy UX for the “Privacy is STARK Normal” campaign. The goal is to pressure-test premium mobile flows, integrate privacy primitives, and share patterns the Starknet ecosystem can adopt when rolling confidential features into consumer apps.

## Why this build

- Demonstrate how a mobile wallet can make private transfers feel effortless.
- Dogfood Starknet privacy components and intentionally design UX around them before mainnet products ship.
- Prepare for integrating confidential transfers with the **Tongo Cash SDK**.
